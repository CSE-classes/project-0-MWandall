Under section 6. Grading, it states that my GitHub username should be the same as my UTA username.
I accepted the GitHub Classroom link while logged into my private GitHub account so please let me know 
if I need to make a new GitHub account with the username as my NetID. 

My current GitHub username is:
MWandall
